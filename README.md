**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

I try to write programs that can be reused in multiple different ways especially for database functions such as CRUD. I could in theory change some of the simple variables such as the DB, USER, PASSWORD etc., and use this function to apply CRUD functionality to any database of data stored withing MongoDB.  I believe working this way kept the code compartmentalized and usable for future CRUD operations and help with readability for anyone in the future that may try and use my code for database functions. If I have any projects in the future that require CRUD functionality, I should be able to modify the code to work for that project saving time and resources.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**
